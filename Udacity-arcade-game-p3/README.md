# Udacity Classic Arcade Game Clone


 This game consists of a princess player character and enemy bugs. The goal of the game is to reach the water, without colliding into any of the enemies, and you  can move left, right, up and down with the keyboard arrow keys. The  killer bugs move in varying speeds across the screen and your manual dexterity and quick reflexes are needed to avoid the enemy bugs and to reach the water. Once the princess collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the princess moves back to the start square. Once the princess reaches the water ten times with out losing three lives, the game is won. Run fast!
